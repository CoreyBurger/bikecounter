Code to pull data from EcoCounter bike counters

This is very much a work in progress. Uses Python, Altair and Vega to pull data from Eco-Counter sites and then visualize it

I am indebted to Chealion and zzptichka for their work on the same topic. Both use different methods of pulling data and visualizing, but without their work, I wouldn't be able to do mine
